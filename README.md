# MyResume

# Input
The input to this web application is the data regarding the user’s resume. This includes personal information like name, contact details, education history, work experience, skills, and projects. This data is hardcoded within the React components 
(Resume.js), and it is displayed dynamically in a structured format on the webpage.

# Process
The process involves React’s components handling the data and displaying it according to the specified design. The Resume.js component structures the data into various sections, such as the header (name and contact), education, skills, work experience, and projects. Each of these sections is styled using Resume.css. The background color, font sizes, margins, and text colors are set according to the project requirements. The useState hook is used for managing any future dynamic interactions, though the current version of this project does not require real-time updates.

# Output
The output of this web app is a neatly formatted resume displayed in a browser. It includes:
A header with the name and contact information.
Sections for education, skills, work experience, and projects.
A styled webpage that is easy to read and visually appealing, matching the specified background color and other design guidelines.
